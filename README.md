# AutoBilliards
 #### Jun-Yu (Andrew) Chen, Yi-Jun Wang

## Introduction
Using the perspective of sport broadcasts we convert the view and crop its boundaries to only the playing area, which may be useful in exhibition matches where top-down perspectives are hard to obtain for end-of-game analysis. We further extended the system to enable auto-scoring for pool games, as in some variants the scoring is quite complex with color detection posing a great challenge.
